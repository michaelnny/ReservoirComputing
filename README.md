Implementing Reservoir Computing Networks for Predicting Dynamic Systems

**NOTE**: This project is intended for educational and research purposes only. Although we've tested the code on certain cases, we cannot guarantee it is bug-free. So bug reports and pull requests are welcome.

# Lorenz System Prediction

Case 1: Given a sequence of X, predict the corresponding Y, Z components.

Case 2: Given a sequence of X, continue to predict X_t+1, X_t+2, ..., X_t_n autonomously.
